The goal of my game is to create a version of flappy bird with a square or cricle that goes though little walls that come up from the bottom and the top with a hole in between them to be able to get through. 
If the charcter hits the wall the chartcer will die and the game will end 
It will 2d going horizontal and kepping score for how many walls it passes through
